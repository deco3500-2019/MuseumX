# Project Overview
#### Problem space (Emma)
  
#### Design process
    how did you tackle this problem? Use images and extended captions to
    explain the design process and how your ideas evolved. Mention any limitations and
    relevant theory.

##### How Ideas Evolved (Zhijiang)
##### Workshop Design
After the final concept was established and discussed, the team decided to organize a design workshop. The team decided to use this design method in the research as it was considered as a most useful step at this stage of the project which will allow not only to evaluate our idea but also help to invite users to the co-design process. The co-design process was most appropriate at this stage: instead of providing users with possible solutions, it was interesting to get inspirations from users and don’t limit them with the existing ideas. 

Therefore the workshop purpose was to understand:
- how the digital version of the artwork and ability to explore it digitally (f.e zooming-in/out) 
- changes users’ emotions/attitude towards the art;
- how to build a personalization process: questionnaire/ keywords/ other;
- how to integrate a person in the piece of art;
- how users perceive the concept, and which things to improve for a better connection of visitor to the artwork.

As a preparation step for the workshop participants were asked to provide their photos and fill in the questionnaire and after answers were collected, pictures that have some connections with the them and relevant descriptions were prepared for each participant.

##### Final Prototype Deign 
The goal of the prototype was to provide an opportunity for visitors to evaluate our concept and to understand if the goal of our project in promoting connection will be achieved. To achieve this, team MuseumX decided to imitate the end-to-end scenario starting from the gathering personal data (keywords and photos), their interaction with a tangible device that will guide them through the exhibition, and lastly the experience with a digital version of painting where visitors could see themselves inside the art objects. The idea was to imitate the context by providing an environment that will be close to reality. Therefore artworks were also printed and placed on the walls. To achieve the personalization aspect and later evaluate the connection between participants, the prototype included interaction with the digital screen that will be their first step when they will come to the exhibition. The prototype was created in Figma and comprised of serious steps that guided participants through the initial stages. The interface contained the stage when participants were asked to choose keywords that were initially derived from pictures with pre-established text descriptions related to them. After this stage participant was provided with a digital token (done using Arduino) that vibrated when he/she reached picture connected to him. This stage was imitated through manually triggered vibrations as all keywords led to the same artwork. This was done due to the limited time that the team had between taking a photo and showing a digital picture. Then visitors were provided with digital version of the painting with their photo incorporated in the artwork. Participants were asked to find the connection and then to read a description related to this specific scene. Each description was prepared in a way to be related to the context of the chosen keyword.
