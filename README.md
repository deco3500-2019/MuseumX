# Project Overview
#### Problem space (Emma)
  
#### Design process
    how did you tackle this problem? Use images and extended captions to
    explain the design process and how your ideas evolved. Mention any limitations and
    relevant theory.

##### How Ideas Evolved (Zhijiang)
##### Workshop Design
After the final concept was established and discussed, the team decided to organize a design workshop. The team decided to use this design method in the research as it was considered as a most useful step at this stage of the project which will allow not only to evaluate our idea but also help to invite users to the co-design process. The co-design process was most appropriate at this stage: instead of providing users with possible solutions, it was interesting to get inspirations from users and don’t limit them with the existing ideas. 

Therefore the workshop purpose was to understand:
- how the digital version of the artwork and ability to explore it digitally (f.e zooming-in/out) 
- changes users’ emotions/attitude towards the art;
- how to build a personalization process: questionnaire/ keywords/ other;
- how to integrate a person in the piece of art;
- how users perceive the concept, and which things to improve for a better connection of visitor to the artwork.

As a preparation step for the workshop participants were asked to provide their photos and fill in the questionnaire and after answers were collected, pictures that have some connections with the them and relevant descriptions were prepared for each participant.
