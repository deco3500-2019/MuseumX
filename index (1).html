                <div class="description">In this painting we see a man having a blue cloak being put on him by a woman. Based on Netherlandish Proverbs being “wrapped in a blue cloak” means “to be deceived” .In 1559, when the piece was painted, red was a color of sin. At the same time, the blue cloak she’s draping over her husband tells the other half of the tale. Blue often stood for cheating or folly, which lets us know that this woman isn’t simply handing over her husband’s coat, but rather cheating on him!</div>

                <div class="description">With this roof covered with tarts, author wanted to communicate proverb: "To have the roof tiled with tarts". A modern equivalent could be describing something as gold-plated. As an adjective, tart describes a sour taste, like lemon, or harsh words, like your friend's tart reply to a question that makes her mad. In the 19th century, tart was British slang for "pretty woman." Some believe it is a shortening of "sweetheart." But by the end of that century, tart described a prostitute, something many language scholars trace back to the tart that you get at the bakery.</div>

         <div class="description">The Fox and the Stork ,If you trick someone they might get back at you,A fox invites the stork to eat with him and provides soup in a bowl, which the fox can lap up easily; however, the stork cannot drink it with its beak. The stork then invites the fox to a meal, which is served in a narrow-necked vessel. It is easy for the stork to access but impossible for the fox. The moral drawn is that the trickster must expect trickery in return and that the golden rule of conduct is for one to do to others what one would wish for oneself.</div>

         <div class="description">To carry out a dangerous or impractical plan,t is clear that in mediaeval times the fable was applied to political situations and that British commentaries on it were sharply critical of the limited democratic processes of the day and their ability to resolve social conflict when class interests were at stake. This applies equally to the plot against the king's favourite in 15th century Scotland and the direct means that Archibald Douglas chose to resolve the issue. </div>

         <div class="description">“To piss against the moon” essentially means “to waste one’s time on a futile endeavour”. It is a proverb that Bruegel seemed to enjoy drawing, possibly thanks to the delicate and humorous motif. A somewhat more literal translation it means: Whatever I pursue, I cannot reach it, I keep pissing against the moon.</div>

         <div class="description">PROVERB:To be armed to the teeth The term originated in port royal Jamaica in the 1600s, when pirates were constantly looking for ships to loot and their guns were very primitive. As a result , pirates could shoot only once before a long reloading process. Consequently, they needed to carry a gun in each hand, and also perhaps in each pocket. For extra power, they would also hold knife  between their teeth. So to be “armed to the teeth” means to carry the maximum number of weapons possible.</div>
